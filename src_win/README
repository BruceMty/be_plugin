To cross-compile Windows executables and build the Windows installer:

1) Run the latest bulk_extractor/src_win/CONFIGURE_F20.sh configure script
to set up Fedora with the mingw environment required for cross-compiling
to Windows.  Please obtain the CONFIGURE_F20.sh script from
http://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor.

2) type "make" to build the Windows installer.
